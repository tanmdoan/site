## Next.js is taking over! (Part 1)

If you've talked to me recently about programming then you know how bullish I am about Next.js. 2020 I felt was a year where React frameworks really stole the center stage for the React ecosystem.
If you are familar with React, then you've probably used a primer such as `Create-React-App` for example, and Next.js is like such primer but with lots of bells and whistles out of the box. Some of the notable features right out the box to name a few are an intuitive file system routing, SSR/SSG, zero config, fast refresh, and so many other features. After working in three different projects from a couple organizations, I can
proudly say that not only am I drinking the Next.js kool-aid, but I've recently started serving it to others.

## Eye candy reasons

Let's start with how impressive Next.js is given that [Vercel](https://vercel.com) has been building this framework as a pet project initially. Vercel is similar to app deployment services such as Netlify and Firebase to name a few, and that was initially their core business when they were formally named Now (Zeit). Post re-branding they seemed to have shifted to providing everything you would need to build a successful front end applications. When I was at Tuft & Needle, we were early adopters of the legacy Vercel platform, and we had the honor to work really closely with their team with a dedicated line of Slack support.

On December 15th, 2020, Vercel announced $40M in new funding and it sounds like they're going to invest a lot of that into Next.js. You can read more about the annoucement [here](https://vercel.com/blog/series-b-40m-to-build-the-next-web). /

A trend I've been noticing in the tech industry is that there's been a healthy amount collaboration, maybe due to a boom in remote work? Maybe just the natural progression. At the Next.js Conf this year, I saw some really incredible partnerships that is paving the way for the FE ecosystem that is really exciting. Near Christmas Dan Abramov and Lauren Tan from the FaceBook team gave us a sneak peek into [React Server Components](https://reactjs.org/blog/2020/12/21/data-fetching-with-react-server-components.html), and a key take away from the annoucement is that it should be coming to Next.js soon thanks to the fact that FB, Next.js, and Google are orking together on a Webpack plugin which makes all this possible.

Next.js is used by some of the biggest names in tech including Apple, AirBnb, Trip Advisor, Hashicorp and so many more.

There are so many more reasons why I think Next.js is the present and the future but here's a very concise list:

* Customer (developer) centric
* Obsessed with speed and ease
* Community driven
* Adoption/mentions from notable React leaders (Josh Comeau, Kent C. Dodds)

Some cons:

* Things are changing rapidly (could be a pro as well)
* Crowded market: Remix, Gatsby.js, Create-React-App etc.

Okay Tan, you've really got me sold on Next.js, how can I learn more or get started?

First of all, the Next.js documentation is world class with an interactive quiz to help guide you through as you build a sample app. This foundation of this blog  was built using that tutorial.
Next, check out [Mastering Next.js](https://masteringnextjs.com/) and [React 2025](https://react2025.com/) by the awesome [Lee Robinson](https://twitter.com/leeerob).
Lastly, there is a discord you could join if you have any questions or want to just be up to date with the community.

## Closing

I appreciate you taking time out of your day to read to some of my thoughts, hopefully you learned something today!

Best, \
